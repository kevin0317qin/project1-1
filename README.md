# Project 1
For this project, you will design and implement a data structure to store information about hotels in San Francisco and 
corresponding hotel reviews. You will also provide a basic command line interface to query this data. The data structures you use for this project must support efficient search (see below). The data is in JSON files that were obtained from the expedia API. 

See the course website for the description.
